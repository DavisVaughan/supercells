The main function in this package is called `supercells()`.
An overview of its arguments is shown in the table below.

This function expects raster data with one or more layers (representing, for example, different bands, variables, or dates) in the form of a **terra**'s `SpatRaster` object or a **stars**'s `stars` object. 
The resulting superpixels are stored as `sf` polygons with four or more columns containing identification numbers of superpixels, y and x coordinates of their centroids, and one or more columns with average values of variables for each superpixel.

The number of resulting superpixels can be specified with either `k` or `step` arguments.
`k` relates to the desired number of superpixels. 
When the `k` value is set, the algorithm automatically calculates the value of `step`. 
As, by default, cluster centroids are located regularly, the resulting number of superpixels may slightly differ from the number provided as `k`, e.g., a square raster cannot be divided into five equal square areas. 
`step` is the expected distance, in the number of cells, between initial superpixels' centroids. 
This parameter also defines a zone of influence of each cluster center ($2S \times 2S$ region).

In our software, it is also possible to provide a set of points (an `sf` object) as `k` together with the `step` value.
This way, custom cluster centers are used, with each of them attracting cells in the surrounding $2S \times 2S$ region.

While `k` or `step` determines the number of superpixels, the `compactness` argument controls their spatial shape, with its large value giving more importance to spatial distances between cells and superpixels' centers and its smaller value putting more weight
(importance) to the value distance.
The impact of the compactness value depends on the range of input cell values and the selected distance measure.

  **`x`**             An object of class SpatRaster (terra) or class stars (stars)

  : Table: Overview of the arguments accepted by the
  `supercells()` function


By default, the `supercells` function behaves accordingly to the original algorithm described by @achanta2012slic with Euclidean distance used to calculate the distance between values, and the arithmetic mean used to calculate an average value of each superpixel.
However, in this package, both of the above parameters can be customized with the `dist_fun` and `avg_fun` arguments.

The role of the `dist_fun` argument is to specify the distance function used to obtain the distance between values.
It can be done with one of three mechanisms. 
The first is to use one of internal C++ functions, such as `"euclidean"`, `"jsd"` (the Jensen-Shannon distance, @lin_divergence_1991), and `"dtw"` (dynamic time warping).
The second mechanism allows selecting one of 46 distance and similarity measures
implemented in the R package `philentropy` [@dorst_philentropy_2018].
Thirdly, this argument also accepts any user-defined R function that returns one value based on provided two vectors.

The `avg_fun` function, on the other hand, specifies how the values of the superpixels' centers are calculated.
It has two internal functions implemented in C++ - `"mean"` and `"median"`, but also accepts any fitting R function such as, `base::mean()` or `psych::geometric.mean()`.
This also allows providing any other user-defined R function that returns one value based on an R vector.
For example, the `"median"` function can be used when our input data is categorical.

Due to its simplicity, the SLIC algorithm does not consider spatial connectivity directly.
For example, it makes it possible to create a superpixel consisting of two or more distinct patches, where one patch is large while additional ones are distinctly smaller.
The `supercells` function has two arguments, `clean` and `minarea`, allowing to enforce connectivity of the superpixels.
The first argument, `clean`, is a boolean (`TRUE` by default) specifying if the connectivity should be enforced by removing small disconnected patches (by merging with larger neighborhood ones) or promoting small patches to new superpixels.
The role of the second one, `minarea`, is to control how large disconnected patches must be not be removed. 
By default, when `clean = TRUE`, an average area ($A$) is calculated automatically based on the total number of cells divided by a number of superpixels, and next, the minimal size of a superpixel equals $A/(2^2)$.
Alternatively, users can also specify the minimum size of a superpixel by themselves by providing an area in the unit of a number of cells in the `minarea` argument.

The next argument is `iter` - specifying the number of iterations to create the output.
Its default value of 10 follows the advice by @achanta2012slic
This argument defines how many times superpixels (and their centers) are recalculated before obtaining the final results.

By default, the `supercells` function, as R language, is single-threaded -- runs only on a single thread on the CPU and reads the input raster values into the computer memory.
These features may limit the function's usability for raster datasets with millions or more cells and many variables, for which calculations can either be too slow or require more memory that is available. 
To overcome the aforementioned issues, the `supercells` function has two related optional arguments - `chunks` and `future`.

The `chunks` argument is set by default to `FALSE`. 
However, when it is either `TRUE` or some numerical value, then the split, apply, combine procedure is used: input raster is divided into several chunks, each chunk is read into RAM independently and has a set of superpixels derived; this process is repeated for every chunk, and all the results are combined into one final object. 
When the user sets this argument to `TRUE`, the chunks' sizes are calculated automatically, while when the user provides a numerical value to this argument, then the input raster data is split into chunks with user-defined side length (in the number of pixels).
The `future` argument is also set by default to `FALSE`. 
If it is `TRUE`, the user also needs to specify how parallel processing should be performed and on how many CPU threads with `future::plan()`.

The final argument is called `verbose`, which takes an integer value of 0 or larger, where 0 means no additional messages during the calculations, and 1 provides basic messages about the current calculation stage.
